# Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment. A runtime environment is where your program will be executed. It determines what global objects your program can access and it can also impact how it runs.

JavaScript code may be executed in one of two runtime environments:

1. a browser’s runtime environment
2. the Node runtime environment

In 2009, Node was created for running JavaScript as the backend of an application. Before that, you had to use a programming language other than JavaScript for the backend.


Modules are reusable pieces of code in a file that can be exported and then imported for use in another file. A modular program is one whose components can be separated, used individually, and recombined to create a complex system. It should be noted that there are multiple ways of implementing modules depending on the runtime environment in which your code is executed. In JavaScript, there are two runtime environments and each has a preferred module implementation:

The Node runtime environment and the module.exports and require() syntax.
The browser’s runtime environment and the ES6 import/export syntax.
